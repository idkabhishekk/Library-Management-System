# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a C language project designed to streamline library resource management. It allows for the efficient cataloging, borrowing, and returning of books. Through a menu-driven interface, users can add new books, search by title or author, borrow and return books, remove books, and display the entire library catalog.
