Project Description:
<br>
<br>
The Library Management System is a C language project designed to streamline library resource management. It allows for the efficient cataloging, borrowing, and returning of books. Through a menu-driven interface, users can add new books, search by title or author, borrow and return books, remove books, and display the entire library catalog. Each book entry includes an ID, title, author, publication year, and availability status.
<br>
<br>
This system is built to help small libraries organize resources and is an ideal project to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The struct data structure is used to define book attributes, and file handling ensures data is saved and accessible across sessions. Users can manage book availability, with borrowing and returning functions updating the status automatically.
